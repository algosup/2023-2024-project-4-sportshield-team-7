# Collaborative Strategy Document: QA Teams 5, 7 and 8

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the collaboration strategy among teams 5, 7 and 8. It aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the strategies, communication guidelines and practices undertaken during the project. 

This document aims to foster an effective collaboration among quality assurance managers involved in ensuring product or service quality in a seamless synergy.

## 2. Objectives

1. **Information sharing:** Regular sharing of insights, issues and solutions to enhance the already existing tactics and used tools.
2. **Weekly meetings:** The QA of each team will meet on a weekly basis to test other team's firmware on their respective hardware to ensure the expected behaviour fulfills the performance expectations expressed by the client during the project brief.

## 3. Communication channels

1. Our main way of communicating will be during meetings, during which the most concrete decisions will be taken on the testing strategy and the coordination of our efforts.
2. Alternatively, a dedicated Slack channel has been created to ensure seamless communication can take place among QA teams.

## 4. Communication guidelines

1. **Meeting attendance:** All members involved in the collaboration process should attend all the scheduled meetings. In case of an unavailability, the member must send a message on the previously mentionned Slack channel before 9AM of the meeting day.
2. **Meeting participation:** All members of all teams are expected to participate in the exchanges which will be taking place. In case of an incapacity to participate in the debates, the reason must be given at the beginning of the meeting.

## 5. Collaborative tasks

**Weekly testing sessions:** A weekly testing session will be taking place every week to coordinate our efforts on testing activites.
**Knowledge sharing workshops:** Share a global overview of our knowledge across various tools and strategies to adapt our testing phase to more relevant methods
**Hardware sharing:** Testing will happen on the different boards owned by the teams involved to ensure the product validates client's requirements.
**Documentation reviews:** Review documentation of other teams to ensure both a good comprehension and an error-free documentation.
