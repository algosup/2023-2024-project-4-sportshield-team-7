## 1. Introduction

This document describes the functional specifications of the SportShield.

### 1.1 Overview

SportShield is a device that is designed to prevent ski equipment from being stolen. It is a small device that can be attached to the ski equipment and can be controlled using a mobile application. The device is designed to be small and lightweight so that it can be easily attached to the ski equipment without adding any extra weight to the equipment. The device is also designed to be durable and weatherproof so that it can withstand the harsh weather conditions that are common in ski resorts.

### 1.2 Purpose

The purpose of our team is to improve the existing solution and to add new functionalities to the device. The existing solution has some limitations that need to be addressed, like the battery life of the device. The full solution is also composed of a mobile application and a server. The mobile application and the server are outside the scope of our team. Our team is only responsible for the improvement of the device.

### 1.3 Personas

The following personas are the main users of the SportShield:

- **Ski equipment owner**: The ski equipment owner is the primary target of SportShield. The owner would like to take breaks without having to worry about the safety of his equipment. He would also like to be notified if the device detects any motion.

- **Ski equipment renter**: The ski equipment renter is another target of SportShield. The renter would like to be able to rent the equipment without having to worry about the safety of the equipment, to avoid paying the deposit. He would also like to be notified if the device detects any motion.

## 2. Functionalities

The SportShield has already some functionalities, but the existing ones can be improved and new ones have to be added. The following functionalities are ordered by priority.

### 2.1 Battery management

The primary goal of the solution is to improve the battery life of the device. As of now, the battery can only last for three days, at a rate of 2 hours a day. The goal is to increase the battery life to at least 7 days at a rate of 6 hours a day.

### 2.2 Shock detection

The device is equipped with a shock sensor that can detect translations and rotation around three axes. This feature is the most critical feature of the device. Our goal is to ensure that the device can detect any motion. Two types of shocks have to be detected:

- **Shocks**: In this case, the device should only produce a small sound
- **Strong shocks**: In this case, the device should produce a loud sound and send a notification to the mobile application

### 2.3 Unlock

The device is locked by a cable that can be wrapped around ski equipment. Our goal is to ensure that the device can be unlocked at any time using the mobile application.

### 2.4 Alarm

The device is equipped with a buzzer that can produce sound. The device should only produce sound when a motion is detected. Our goal is to ensure that the alarm can be heard and that the device can produce different kinds of alarms depending on the situation.

### 2.5 Notifications

The device should be able to send notifications to the mobile application when a motion is detected. The notification should be sent within 5 seconds of the Strong shock being detected.

### 2.6 GPS positioning

The device should be able to send its position to the mobile application. Our goal is to ensure that the device can send its position at any time.

### 2.7 NFC

The device should be able to communicate with the mobile application or a card using NFC. Our goal is to add this NFC feature to the device.

### 2.8 Alarm management

The user should be able to stop the alarm before the end of a cycle. Our goal is to add this feature to the device.
