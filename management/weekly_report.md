### Next week's action plan

The technical specification writing is in progress as well as the test plan, and the functional will be done on Monday. The KPIs and the roadmap will be defined, and all the hardware will be fully tested. The QA will initiate the GitHub issues templates.

Like last week, we have been very productive. We encountered some hardware issues with the sim module, so this part is paused for now. We are currently waiting for an answer from Coris concerning this issue.

### Next week's action plan 
For now, we will be focused on the management documentation, as we are waiting for an answer. We will try to finish every "in progress" status to be able to prepare the oral presentation.

As we didn't have any project time this week, we didn't make progress. We got an answer from Coris, but too late considering the deadlines, furthermore, we cannot open the given files.

Management and documentation will be done, so the last week can be focused on the oral presentation training.
