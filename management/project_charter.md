## Communication
Effective communication is vital to the success of the SportShield project. Our strategy involves various tools to ensure transparency, efficiency and alignment among all the team members and stakeholders.

### Trello
Trello is used as our primary tool for managing and visualizing the project tasks and deadlines. For our project, Trello is divided into 4 parts: "To do", "In progress", "Done" and "If everything else is done".  Each given tasks are detailed with the due date, the description of the task if not obvious and checklists to follow the progress. This setup provides a clear overview, making it easier to update quickly and adjust as needed.

### Slack
Slack is our day-to-day communication tool as team members. Slack channels are set up for different aspects of the project, which help sort the discussions by topic to make sure that the correct information reaches the correct team member. This routine ensures consistent progress and quick navigation through project challenges. 

### Bi-weekly meeting
Scheduling two meetings per week provides regular updates for the team to synchronize on the progress, discuss challenges and issues and plan ahead. These meetings are very important to make sure that all the team members are on the same page to make decisions. During the said meetings, each team member presents updates on their work so their work can be tracked. This routine helps maintain consistent progress and quickly resolve project issues.
