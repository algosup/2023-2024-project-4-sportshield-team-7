# Risks and Mitigations Plan
## Introduction 
This document covers the risks and the corresponding mitigation strategies for the SportShield project. Its purpose is to identify potential threats to the project's accomplishment that our team could encounter, it will provide effective measures to counter them effectively. 

## Risks and mitigations: 
### 1. Complexity: 
**Risks:** The project may encounter complexities regarding the already existing code or the asked outcome, which could lead to delays. 

**Mitigations:** Allocate dedicated time to review the already existing code to identify potential dependencies and areas of improvement. Every task will be framed, using Trello, to be as efficient as possible. 

### 2. Sudden changes: 
**Risks:** Unexpected changes from the client on the requirements can happen, which can result in a possible delay if the work is already done. 

**Mitigation:** Regular communication between us, the stakeholder and the client will be put in place to ensure that they are satisfied with the provided outcome.  We will ensure proper documentation and an approval procedure for every modification that will be made. 

### 3. Hardware issues:
**Risks:** Issues or malfunction from the PCB, the buzzer, the battery, the NFC antenna or the electromagnet may happen and so disrupt temporarily the progress of our work.

**Mitigations:** Vigorous tests and quality assurance procedures on our components. Establish clear maintenance of all the pieces to ensure reliability during the project. 

### 4. Team member absences: 
**Risks:** Team members can unexpectedly become unavailable due to illness or personal reasons. This could cause project setbacks and increased workload for the other team members.

**Mitigations:** Ensure strong communication among the team to permit an optimal flow of information and updates. This will facilitate the redistribution of tasks in case of unexpected team member absences.


### 5. Inadequate risk management: 
**Risks:** Failure to identify and mitigate project risks effectively, could lead to unexpected issues, delays or failures during the project. 

**Mitigations:** Clearly documented procedures to identify and manage project risks. Establish clear channels of communication to report any risk and provide regular updates about identified risks.
